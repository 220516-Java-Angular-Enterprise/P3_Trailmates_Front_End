# P3_Trailmates_Frontend

---
## Default User Story:
A user logs on to trailmates.com looking for a buddy to hike, they search up a specific trail in the hiking search bar.<br />
Then the user flags that they want to do the hike and see other people that want to do the hike in a similar time frame.<br />
The user then messages another user asking to go on a hike. The other user gets a notification from the original user<br />
who messaged them, and they set up the hiking plan from there.

## MVP
